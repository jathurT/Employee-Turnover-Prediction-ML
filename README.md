# Employee Turnover Prediction

Welcome to my project on **Employee Turnover Prediction**! This project utilizes machine learning techniques to predict employee attrition, helping organizations retain their valuable talent.

## Overview

Employee turnover is a critical issue for many organizations, leading to increased costs and reduced morale. By accurately predicting which employees are at risk of leaving, companies can implement strategies to improve retention and maintain a stable workforce.

## Jupyter Notebook

I have developed a comprehensive Jupyter Notebook that details the entire process, from data preprocessing and exploratory analysis to model building and evaluation. You can view and interact with the notebook here:

## Research Article

For an in-depth understanding of the methodologies and findings, please refer to my research article published on ResearchGate:

## Kaggle Dataset 

The project utilizes data from Kaggle, and you can find the dataset here:

- [Kaggle: Employee Turnover Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/giripujar/hr-analytics)

## Key Features

- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing key metrics and identifying patterns related to employee attrition.
- **Model Development**: Implementing various machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
- **Insights & Recommendations**: Providing actionable insights to help organizations reduce employee turnover.

## Getting Started
